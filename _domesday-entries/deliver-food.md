The Deliver **Food** command orders a character to take **Food** from a settlement and deliver it to another friendly settlement. The amount of Food impacts the amount of time it takes to travel.

A Captain is able to transport more **Food** per command depending on the number of **Troops** available.

After the **Food** is delivered the character stays at the destination settlement.
