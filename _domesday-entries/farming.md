Farming takes place throughout the year, with two Planting/Harvesting cycles in the spring and summer. There is no farming work during the Winter season.

## Planting & Harvesting

Each growing season consists of 3 months of planting **Crops** and 1 month of harvesting **Food**. During the harvest months (March, October) **Farmers** extract the planted food and store it in the settlement.

**Farmers** can only harvest **Food** from the planted **Crops**. Therefore, it is important to ensure you have enough farmers planting to have a big enough harvest, and enough farmers available during harvest so that planted **Crops** do not go to waste.

## Winter

During the winter months **Farmers** get a break! Use them to build things, or put them in an army to get ready for the spring campaign
