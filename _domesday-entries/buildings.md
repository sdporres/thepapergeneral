Buildings allow you to develop your settlements and increase their economic and military capabilities.

## Workers

Farmers can be assigned to buildings to improve or enhance that building's performance. The effect of workers depends on the building.

## Construction

After starting construction on a new building, Workers need to be assigned to actually do the work. These workers will revert to being Farmers once construction is complete.

## Tear Down

Buildings can be torn down so that something else may be built in their stead. Tearing a building down costs a fraction of the time and **Coin** to construct the building.

## Building Descriptions

### Manor

The manor is the residence of the Lord. Workers assigned to the manor represent servants of the Lord helping to make the settlement more efficient. The manor grants a bonus to most of the activities of the settlement.

### Cottage

Cottages provide homes for the settlement population. Workers assigned to a cottage contribute to the growth of the population of the settlement. A shortage of cottages will impair the growth of the settlement.

### Market

Markets enable the population of the settlement to trade. Workers assigned to a market produce **Coin** every day.

### Tavern

Taverns allow the recruitment of **Mercenaries**. Workers assigned to taverns increase the rate at which mercenaries become available. More Taverns allows for a greater number of mercenaries to be available at a time.
