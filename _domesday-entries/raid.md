The Raid command instructs a Captain to go to an enemy settlement and burn crops and destroy buildings.

Depending on the **skill** of the Captain, a raid may be stealthy or not. An experienced raider may be able to do a lot of damage before the defenders can respond.

After the raid the Captain and their troops return to the friendly settlement.

If an undefended settlement is raided it will be captured by the attacks.
