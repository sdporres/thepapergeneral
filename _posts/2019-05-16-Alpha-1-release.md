## He who controls the settlements, controls the resources

Here is an overview of what the game is about!

![screenshot1][alpha1-zoomedout]{: .post-image }  

In this version, you are given three characters and a starting settlement. Your goal is to take the AI player's settlements, or kill all of
their characters. At the heart of this part of the game are settlements, which produce the resources in the game.

To improve a settlements productivity, there are two types of buildings you can construct (in addition to the Manor that every settlement has - thats like the HQ). You can assign workers to the three building types, but that detracts from the number of farmers in the settlement.

You can transfers farmers and Food from settlements to your characters and march off to fight other characters, or siege an enemy settlement.

Your characters can take actions, depending on where they are and other characters around them.

Compare your progress against your enemy - don't let them get to far ahead!
